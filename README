HostTag README
==============

HostTag is a very simple system for defining hosts and associating arbitrary 
tags (groups, classes) with those hosts. 

It uses the redis key-value store to store and make available the host => tag 
mappings, and provides a simple 'hosttag' (or 'ht') client to query those
mappings.

Initially only the client was network capable; tags had to be maintained on 
the server (in the /etc/hosttag directory).


Client Usage
------------

Querying:

* ht <foo>

  Show all the hosts that have tag <foo> set


* ht [-a] <tag1> <tag2>

  Show all the hosts that have <tag1> AND <tag2> set (intersection)


* ht -o <tag1> <tag2>

  Show all the hosts that have <tag1> OR <tag2> set (union)


* ht -A 

  Show *all* hosts




* ht -t <host> 

  Show the tags on host <host>

* ht -a <host1> <host2>

  Show the tags that occur on both host1 and host2 (intersection)

* ht -o <host1> <host2>

  Show the tags that occur on either host1 and host2 (union)

* ht -T

  Show *all* tags








TODO - Management Utilities
---------------------------

e.g.

* htset -h <host1> [-h <host2>] <tag1> [<tag2> <tag3>]

  Set tag(s) on this host


* htset -t <tag> [-t <tag2>] <host1> [<host2> <host3>]

  Set tag(s) on hosts
  


* htremove -h <bar> <tag1> <tag2> <tag3>

  Remove these tags from this host


* htremove -t <tag> <host1> <host2> <host3>

  Remove this tag from these hosts
