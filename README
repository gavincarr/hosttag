Introduction
------------

Hosttag is a client for tagging hostnames into groups or classes, storing 
the mappings in a redis datastore. It requires the 'redis' rubygem.


Hosttag assumes your redis server is found on a server called 'hosttag' on
the default redis port (6379). You can either setup 'hosttag' as a hostname
alias in a local hosts file, or specify an alternative host to use in a
HOSTTAG_SERVER environment variable, or explicitly via a -s/--server
<hostname> argument. Similarly, an alternate port can be specified using a
HOSTTAG_PORT environment variable, or a -p/--port <port> command line
argument.



Basic Usage
-----------

  # Set some tags (-T says assume anything you don't know is a tag)
  $ htset -T zeus dell centos centos5 server
  $ htset -T minerva dell centos centos6 laptop
  $ htset -T hermes hp ubuntu lucid desktop
  $ htset -T athena hp ubuntu maverick server


  # Queries
  $ ht dell               
  minerva zeus

  $ ht ubuntu
  hermes athena

  $ ht -o hp dell         # -o/--or ORs arguments
  hermes minerva zeus

  $ ht -a ubuntu server   # -a/--and ANDs arguments
  athena

  $ ht -o de*             # tags and hosts may include globs (*, ?, [M-N])
  zeus minerva hermes

  $ ht -A                 # all hosts
  athena hermes minerva zeus

  $ ht -T                 # all tags
  centos centos5 centos6 dell desktop hp laptop lucid maverick server




Security
--------

A warning on security: basically, there isn't any. Anyone who can get write
to your redis server can write, rewrite, and delete all your hosttags. So
you should only use hosttag on a trusted network.

Redis supports a password-ed mode, and it might make sense to use that via
a config file or something, so you could at least restrict usage via file
permissions (although traffic would still be in the clear, I believe). For
now, though, there's no security.



Installation
------------

To install from source, unpack the tarball and run 'rake install' (requires
rubygems and rake). You can set GEM_HOME to an alternate install directory 
(e.g. ~/.gem) if you want to install somewhere other than your gem default.

RPMs are available for CentOS/RHEL {5,6} from the Open Fusion repository:
