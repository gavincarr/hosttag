The server side of hosttag requires the TokyoCabinet DBM libraries and the
TokyoTyrant network server, as well as the TokyoClient perl module.

Then, to add hosttags: create host directories inside the (inner) data 
directory, and touch tag files within the host directories e.g.

  cd data
  mkdir host1 host2 host3
  touch host1/{tag1,tag2,tag3}
  touch host2/{tag1,tag2,tag3}

and then go up a level and run 'make'

  cd ..
  make
